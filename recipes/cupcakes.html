  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These are Raspberry Lemon Cream Cheese Cupcakes. If you don't like raspberries or lemon or cream cheese or
    cupcakes, you probably shouldn't make this recipe.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p><b>Cupcakes</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup (169 grams) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (1/2 stick or 57 grams) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (76 grams) sour cream (or plain, non-fat yogurt)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (59 ml) vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups (175 grams) cake flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Juice from 1/2 lemon</li>
    <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (9 ounces or 255 grams) fresh raspberries</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Frosting</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>8 ounces (227 grams) cream cheese, room temperature</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (1/2 stick or 57 grams) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>4 cups (500 grams) powdered sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <p><b>Cupcakes</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a cupcake pan with baking cups.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix together the sugar and lemon zest with your fingers until fragrant (about 1-2
      minutes).</li>
    <li>Add the butter and beat until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
    <li>Beat in the sour cream, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. </li>
    <li>Gradually add in the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and
      salt. Mix in the milk and lemon juice, stirring until batter is uniform and smooth.</li>
    <li>Gently stir in the raspberries.</li>
    <li>Fill baking cups about 2/3 full and bake for 16-18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes
      out clean.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, transfer cupcakes to a cooling rack, and allow to cool to room temperature before
      frosting.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>Frosting</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat together the cream cheese and butter until smooth.</li>
    <li>Beat in the salt and vanilla.</li>
    <li>Gradually beat in the powdered sugar. If frosting is too soft, add more powdered sugar until it reaches a spreadable consistency. Likewise, if the frosting is too stiff, add milk until it reaches a spreadable consistency.</li>
    <li>Before serving, pipe or spread frosting on top of cooled cupcakes and decorate with a few fresh raspberries, if desired.</li>
    <li>If cupcakes will sit out more than a day, keep refrigerated in an airtight container to help preserve them.</li>
    <li>Serve at room temperature.</li>
  </ol>
